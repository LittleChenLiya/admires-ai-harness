# Evaluation methodology

The evaluation system measures the harness, not only the prose of a final answer. Each case
has a stable ID, input, optional fixture workspace, execution budget, and one or more graders.
Reports preserve per-grader evidence, trace/run IDs, latency, tokens, cost, and harness
version.

Deterministic graders are ordered by strength:

1. policy outcome and terminal status;
2. executable tests or artifact assertions;
3. required tool/delegation trajectory;
4. exact or contains checks on final text.

A candidate report can be compared with a previously saved report by passing `--baseline`;
the comparison fails on newly failing cases or a configured score regression and reports
improvements separately. The required CI gate instead runs the checked-in deterministic
dataset directly and requires every case to pass. Randomized or live-provider evals are
informative and are never mixed into that offline gate.

`uv run admire evaluate` always writes one JSON report to stdout and never wraps long
lines, so the output stays machine-parseable. It exits `0` when every case passes, `1`
when cases fail, the baseline comparison regresses, or `--report` cannot be written (the
JSON report is still emitted first), and `2` for invalid arguments such as a missing or
malformed dataset or baseline file. Failure details go to stderr; sensitive settings and
environment variables are redacted and never printed.

The checked-in reference dataset contains three deterministic positive cases, one per demo.
Security and recovery negative paths (denied write, escaped path, stale approval, budget
exhaustion, concurrent resume, and approval recovery) live in focused pytest suites rather
than in that JSONL dataset.
